## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

The main challenge for a company that intends to lend money (for example through venture capital (VC)) is to optimize the investment
in order to realize a big return. 
Our fundamental question here is therefore: How much return will the investor realize on his investment using our simulation?
Given some (realistic) initial conditions, how is our simulation going to react after adding an additional "noise information" 
of 5 percent for example (in our case, a misinformation that includes a variation of 5% either positively or negatively of 
the needer's money amount)? 
The last point that arises from the last idea is the importance of this "noise information": we will try to simulate 
the moment at which the noise becomes either to big and induces a big loss for the investor or the opposite.


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References

## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)
